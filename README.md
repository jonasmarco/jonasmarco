#### Hi there 👋, welcome to my space \o/ 

Brazilian and passionate about technology, graduated in Systems Analysis and Development from the Federal Institute of Paraná. I started my career as an intern in 2016 where I had my first contact with front-end. Since then I already have some experience in the area.

My focus is to develop websites and applications for the real world, be it a landing page, mobile application or a large system, always focusing on the best possible delivery for the client.

We know how volatile our area is, so I'm always acquiring new knowledge and accepting new challenges. My goal is to one day make a living from my freelance work, working and traveling around the world.

Would you like to find me?
