#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, welcome to my page \o/

I'm a Brazilian technology enthusiast, with a degree in Systems Analysis and Development from the Federal Institute of ParanÃ¡. I began my career as an intern in 2016, where I had my first contact with front-end development. Since then, I have gained some experience in the field.

My focus is on developing websites and applications for real-world scenarios, whether it's a landing page, mobile application, or a large-scale system, always striving for the best possible outcome for the client.

As we all know, our field is constantly evolving, so I'm always expanding my knowledge and welcoming new challenges. My ultimate goal is to one day make a living from my freelance work, working and traveling around the world.

Do you want to get in touch with me?
